# How to Get Unbanned on Conan Exiles (2025 Guide) 🏹

Getting banned from Conan Exiles can be a major buzzkill, especially if you think the gods of Hyboria got it wrong. Fear not! This easy, no-nonsense guide will show you how to tackle your ban like a true warrior and get back to building, raiding, and surviving.

## Maybe You Are HWID Banned? 🖥️

Did your ban follow you to a fresh new account? Or does every new attempt to join feel like a slap from Set himself? You might be **HWID banned** (Hardware ID Ban)! This means Conan Exiles has blacklisted your PC hardware, making it impossible to sneak back in—even with a brand new profile.
